$p[]="We build our School on Thee, O Lord, 
To Thee we bring our common need, 
The loving heart, the helpful word, 
The tender thought, the kindly deed. 

We work together in Thy sight, 
We live together in Thy love; 
Guide Thou our faltering steps aright, 
And lift our thoughts to Heaven above. 

Hold Thou each hand to keep it just, 
Touch Thou our lips and make them pure; 
If Thou art with us, Lord, we must 
Be faithful friends and comrades sure. 

We change, but Thou art still the same, 
The same good Master, Teacher, Friend; 
We change, but Lord, we bear Thy Name, 
To journey with it to the end. 

Dear Lord we pray, 
Thy Spirit may Be present in our school alway.";
$p[]="Once again we here foregather, 
pledge obedience to this rule: 
That we ever will be faithful 
to the teachings of our School. 

Justice, Honour, Truth and Virtue 
shall the watchwords be for all. 
We thy sons who learnt these precepts 
in the College of St. Paul, 

Brothers here we stand together 
all for each and each for all. 
Down the years we will be faithful 
to the College of St. Paul.";
